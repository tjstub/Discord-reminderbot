# Discord-reminderbot

An oversimplified reminder bot for game-night. This bot is still
in the early stages of development.


# Features

The bot currently supports Rolling dice and a fixed reminder. The Fixed reminder is still a Work in Progress.

## Commands

### Rollers

```
/mb <integer>
```

Rolls the Mistborn RPG die

```
/r <expression>
```

Rolls a general poly-dice. This follows the syntax of the `xdice` python package, but will eventually have its own syntax.
